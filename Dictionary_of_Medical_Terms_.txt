anatomical terms 
the body is always described as if standing upright with the palms of the handsfacing forward .  there is only one central vertical plane , termed the median or sagittal plane , and this passes through the body from front to back .  planes parallelto this on either side are parasagittal or paramedian planes .  vertical planes at rightangles to the median are called coronal planes .  the term horizontal ( or transverse )plane speaks for itself .  two specific horizontal planes are ( a ) the transpyloric ,midway between the suprasternal notch and the symphysis pubis , and ( b ) thetranstubercular or intertubercular plane , which passes through the tubercles of theiliac crests .  many other planes are named from the structures they pass through .  
views of the body from some different points are shown on the diagram ; a view ofthe body from above is called the superior aspect , and that from below is the inferior aspect .  
cephalic means toward the head ; caudal refers to positions ( or in a direction )towards the tail .  proximal and distal refer to positions respectively closer to andfurther from the centre of the body in any direction , while lateral and medial relate more specifically to relative sideways positions , and also refer to movements . ventral refers to the abdomen , front or anterior , while dorsal relates to the back of a part or organ .  the hand has a dorsal and a palmar surface , and the foot a dorsal and a plantar surface .  
note that flexion of the thigh moves it forward while flexion of the leg moves it backwards ; the movements of extension are similarly reversed .  movement androtation of limbs can be medial , which is with the front moving towards the centreline , or lateral , which is in the opposite direction .  specific terms for limb movements are adduction , towards the centre line , and abduction , which is awayfrom the centre line .  other specific terms are supination and pronation for the hand , and inversion and eversion for the foot .
